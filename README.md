This repository contains the complete solution for a Data Analyst Assignment using SQL, Excel, and Python. The project demonstrates how to design databases, analyze data using spreadsheets, and implement basic logic using Python scripts. All components are organized neatly into separate folders for easy navigation.

📌 Summary

✔ SQL:

This section includes table creation, sample data insertion, and analytical queries for both Hotel and Clinic systems.
Key tasks include:
-Creating clean and normalized database schemas
-Inserting sample data for testing
-Writing queries to identify last bookings, calculate billing amounts, determine most/least ordered items, and compute monthly profitability

✔ Excel:

The Excel file focuses on time-based ticket analysis using formulas and pivot tables.
It includes:

-Using VLOOKUP / INDEX-MATCH to fill missing values
-Adding helper columns to extract dates, hours, and logical checks (same day/hour)
-Using COUNTIF to calculate outlet-wise ticket counts for same-day and same-hour closures

✔ Python:

Two simple Python scripts demonstrate logical problem solving.
These scripts include:

-Converting minutes into a readable “hours + minutes” format
-Removing duplicate characters from a string while keeping their original order
